    <h1>The Vaydor SuperCar</h1>

    <h2>5 reasons the Vaydor G35 is even cooler than it looks</h2>
    <p><strong>What the heck is a Vaydor G35? Well, it's actually an elaborate body kit for a 2004 to 2007 <br>
    Infiniti G35.</strong></p>
    <p>
        The kit car can be built in under 2 months and for less than $40,000. Before you know it, you too <br>
        could be driving around town in your own supercar without spending a fortune.
        <br>
        <br>
        While there are many critics of the Vaydor G35 all over the internet, we wanted to share a few of <br>
        the reasons we think it’s awesome.
    </p>
    <img src="pics/vaydor_g35.jpg" alt="vaydor g35">
    <h1>1. It was Designed by an Average Guy with No Money</h1>
    <p>My favorite part about the Vaydor body kit origin is that it is the perfect underdog story. The kit was <br>
       designed by Matt McEntegart, a normal guy that loves cars and always wished he could own a <br>
        supercar. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the money to buy one, so he built it himself.
        <br>
        <br>
        He’s even said that he didn’t go to design school, he just learned as he went. The goal for the <br>
         Vaydor G35 was to build a car that looked just like a factory production supercar that you could <br>
          build in your garage.
        <br>
        <br>
        It wasn’t designed by a company looking to make huge profits (though he eventually might). <br>
        Instead, it was designed by a regular guy that wanted to share his dream of driving an affordable <br>
        supercar with others.
    </p>
    <h1>2. It’s an Infiniti G35 Underneath</h1>
    <img src="pics/infiniti_g35.jpg" alt="infiniti g35">
    <p>One of the reasons the Vaydor G35 is so affordable is because it uses an Infiniti G35 as the donor <br>
         car. The kit is only compatible with 2003-2007 Infiniti G35 coupes. The designer, Matt McEntegart, <br>
          likes to describe the Vaydor G35 body kit as a “re-body fiberglass kit.”
          <br>
          <br>
          Essentially, the kit just replaces the original body of the Infiniti G35. According to the Vaydor <br>
           website, 90 percent of what you need to build a Vaydor G35 is from the original Infiniti G35. <br>
            The rest of the parts needed are included in the kit.
            <br>
            <br>
            Matt says he picked the Infiniti G35 because a lot of engineering development went into the design <br>
             of the chassis by the manufacturer. Whereas, most modern chassis today have a “junk” design.
        </p>
        <h1>3. The Kit Costs Only $11,000</h1>
        <p>When the designer, Matt McEntegart, said he wanted to build an affordable kit car he wasn’t <br>
             kidding. The kit to build your own Vaydor G35 only costs $11,000!
             <br>
             <br>
             Considering that at the end of the project you’ll have a supercar that looks like it cost a million <br>
              dollars, 11 grand is almost nothing. The funny part is that when the Vaydor debuted at SEMA this <br>
               year, many people were disappointed that the car only cost about $40,000 total to build instead of <br>
              $200k to $300k.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you’ve never shopped around for kit cars before, let me give you some perspective. The popular <br>
              which costs almost $25,000.
               427 Cobra kit car, which is a staple at car shows everywhere, costs about $10,000 for the fiberglass <br>
                body. A more comparable kit to the Vaydor G35 would be the GTM Supercar kit by Factory Five <br>
                which costs almost $25,000.
            </p>
            <h3>What's included in the kit?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 main rear body shell</li>

                <li>1 full 8-point roll cage</li>
                <li>2 dot headlights</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>4. It Takes Only Two Months to Build</h1>
            <p>It has been said that building a Vaydor G35 is not necessarily hard but it is a lot of work. The Infiniti <br>
                 G35 donor car that’s used as the base comes with 90 percent of the parts you’ll need to complete <br>
                 the project. However, you will need some cutting and welding experience if you plan to have any <br>
                 success with this kit.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The first step in the process is to cut the car down to the chassis. That means removing all of the <br>
                  body panels, window glass and cutting off the roof.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Then, you’ll need to weld in the 8-point roll cage to add strength back into the car. This becomes <br>
                   the base that you’ll attach the new fiberglass body to.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   While this sounds like a lot of work, the good news is that it does not require you to stretch the <br>
                    chassis or modify the stock wheelbase. You also don’t need to cut any wiring or modify an major <br>
                    mechanical parts.
                </p>
                <h1>5. You Can Buy Them Premade</h1>
                <p>If two months or more of working on a car sounds like too much work, I have some good news. <br>
                     Many custom car builders have been offering to build Vaydor G35’s from scratch for a flat fee. They <br>
                     will even provide the donor car.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Base prices start at $75,000 from companies such as Premier Motor Workz and Custom Crafted <br>
                      Cars.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      You could also contact a local fabrication shop near you to complete the work. However, since they <br>
                       likely have not put together a Vaydor body kit before, your total cost may vary. This is one of the <br>
                       reasons to use an experienced shop that sells Vaydor packages. You may get a higher quality <br>
                       product at a lower cost and in less time, compared to a local fabrication shop.

                    <h1>Bonus: It Was in the Suicide Squad Film</h1>
                    <img src="pics/suicide_squad.jpg" alt="suicide squad photo">
                    <p> I can’t forget that one of the reasons the Vaydor G35 became so popular this year was because of <br>
                         its recent appearance in the movie Suicide Squad.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         The film is about a team of DC Comics supervillains that have been recruited by a secret <br>
                          government agency to help with dangerous missions and save the world. One of the main <br>
                          characters in the Suicide Squad movie is the one and only Joker.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          The Joker’s ride is a pink chrome car that could easily be confused with a Lamborghini to the <br>
                           untrained eye. However, true car fans that watched the movie, knew the car was something <br>
                           completely different than they had seen before.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           It was in fact a Vaydor G35 with a pink chrome wrap and a custom white interior.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>Have you ever wished you could get production style supercar without spending a fortune? Well, <br>
                             your wish has been granted.
                             <br>

                             The Vaydor G35 body kit will transform an Infiniti G35 into a sleek supercar with 280 horsepower <br>
                              for under $40,000.

                              Even though the Vaydor is inexpensive to build, there are still very few on the streets due to limited <br>
                               production. In fact, as little as 20 per year are being produced by Vaydor Exotics. For your free <br>
