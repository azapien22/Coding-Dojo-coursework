//Cartman doesn’t really like math; he needs help. You are given two numbers – coefficients M and B in the equation Y = MX + B. 
//Build a function to return the X-intercept (his older cousin Fiaz wisely reminds him that X-intercept is the value of X where Y equals zero; 
//Cartman just snorts in his general direction).
function mathHelp(M,B){
    console.log('X -intercept is' + (0-B)/M);
