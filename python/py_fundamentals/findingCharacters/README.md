Assignment: Find Characters
Write a program that takes a list of strings and a string containing a single character, and prints a new list of all the strings containing that character.

Here's an example:

# input
word_list = ['hello','world','my','name','is','Anna']
char = 'o'
# output
new_list = ['hello','world']
copy
Hint: how many loops will you need to complete this task?
